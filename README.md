# codeFriends

codeFriends is an e-commerce website created by four classmates as part of Grace Hopper Academy's Senior curriculum.
Our products (imaginary coding friends) are created to keep programmers company when they are coding on quiet and lonely nights. The friends could cheer you up, listen to your rants about bugs, and even celebrate when your codes work flawlessly -- all virtually! 

You can check out our website at https://evening-bayou-19167.herokuapp.com/
It was created with the SEAN stack (Sequelize, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js), passport.js, express-session.js, Bootstrap, jQuery, and HTML.
